# Proxy

- is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. 
- adding a layer of functionality to control access to the original object

## types:

- **Virtual Proxy** - caching, logging, access control, lazy initialization, etc.
- **Protection Proxy** - access control, authentication, logging, etc.
- **Remote Proxy** - local representation of an object that is in a different address space
- **Smart Proxy** - additional housekeeping functions when an object is accessed
