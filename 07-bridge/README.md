## Bridge Pattern

- a structural design pattern
- connects the abstraction and implementation through composition
- decouples the abstraction from implementation 

### Usage

- when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation
- when you want to avoid an explosion of subclasses
