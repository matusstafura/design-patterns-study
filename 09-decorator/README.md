# Decorator Design Pattern

- a structural design pattern that allows behaviour to be added to an individual object without modifying the object's code.
- a wrapper for new behaviours

## Usage

- if you want to extend an object's behaviour without making a new subclass
- you can add or remove responsibilities from an object at runtime


## Structure

1. Component (Interface/Abstract Class)
2. Concrete Component
3. Decorator
4. Concrete Decorators
